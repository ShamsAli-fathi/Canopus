# Description

In wireless telecommunications, the signal strength decreases or attenuates during transmission, especially over long distances. The attenuation increases exponentially with the distance between the transmitter and the receiver. This report attempts to assist in estimating the attenuation in different conditions. One common model for path loss estimation is the Path Loss Exponent and Shadowing Gaussian Noise models in urban environments, which we will explore using machine learning techniques.

## Tools

- Python
- IPhone 8
- Network Cell Info Lite

## Problem

In telecommunications engineering, the Friis equation, also known as the free space path loss (FSPL) equation, is used to calculate the power received by an antenna at a certain distance from a transmitting antenna. The equation depends on factors like transmitted power (Pt), transmitting antenna gain (Gt), receiving antenna gain (Gr), and distance (d).

To calculate the path loss (PL) and power received (Pr), we can simplify the Friis equation as follows:

$$Pr = P_{t} \cdot G_{t} \cdot G_{r} \left( \frac{\lambda}{4 \pi R} \right)^2$$

or in logarithmic form:

$$Pr = P_{t} + G_{t} + G_{r} - P_{L}$$

where the path loss is:

$$P_{L}= \beta \cdot 10~log_{10}(\frac{4\pi d}{\lambda})$$

Further simplifying, we get:

$$P_{r}= P_{0} - \beta \cdot 10~log_{10}(\frac{d}{d_{0}}) + X_{\sigma}$$

Here, $X_{\sigma}$ is Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance $\sigma^2$.

| Parameter    | Description                                             |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| $P_{0}$      | the reference received power                            |
| $d_{0}$      | reference distance                                      |
| $X_{\sigma}$ | Gaussian noise with standard deviation between 4 and 12 |

The goal of this project is to estimate the parameters
$\beta$ and $X_{\sigma}$ through data collection and regression.

## Execution

### 1.Data Collection

The signal strength and distance between the phone and the base stations were measured at various points, including line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight locations (such as streets and parks). This sampling process was done every second as we moved between different base stations.

### 2.Reference Value Estimation

Using regression on the collected data, we estimate the reference received power
$P_{0}$â€‹
and the reference distance
$d_{0}$.
In this experiment, we assume a reference distance of 10 meters.

### 3.Path Loss Coefficient and Noise Estimation:

By fitting a curve to the signal strength data, we estimate the path loss coefficient

$$\beta : 1.5035$$

and the noise standard deviation

$$\sigma : 13.4487$$
